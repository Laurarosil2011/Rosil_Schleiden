1. Project Title
My project title is 'Shape generator'.
2. What is the purpose of your project? explain your project.
The Shape Generator Program is a software application designed to generate various geometric shapes based on user input, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for creating
and visualizing shapes. The program supplies to students, educators, and professionals in mathematics, engineering, and design fields, facilitating learning and exploration, and assisting
in quick shape generation and visualization for various applications. Key features include real-time shape generation and visualization, customization options, and export and save options.
The program offers benefits such as improved understanding of geometric shapes, targeting students, as well as educators and professionals seeking interactive tools to illustrate mathematical
concepts.
3. How to run your project or program?
To run my project, you'll need to follow these steps. First, ensure that you have installed python in your computer and use Visual Studio Code. Next, open my shape generator in VS code
and make sure Python interpreter is selected. Then click on the "Run" button to execute the program. Once the program is running, you can interact with it by typing the name of the shape
you want to generate (mainly composed of the shapes: triangle, square, pentagon, hexagon.) and the program will display the corresponding shapes.
